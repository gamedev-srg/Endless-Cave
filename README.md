# The Endless Cave

## The game:
A claustrophobic Thief finds himself trapped in a nightmarish cave, can he escape?
Make your way through this endless cave and look for the treasure to pass into the next level!
Avoid enemies and break through the cave walls to carve your path!

## The player:
* Move using the Arrow Keys or mouse.
* You can mine walls by pressing X and the arrow keys to break down an adjacant wall, but be warned! You are slowed while mining!
* Reach the treasure at the top right corner to pass into the next level.
* You have 3 HP, don't get hit!

## Enemies:
* The enemies in the cave will hunt you down if they have a path to you, and if they are in range to detect you.
* Some of them may be hiding so be careful!
* Enemies increase in amount, speed, and detection radius as you progress through the game!

## In regards to the task:
This game is for sections E and F in the homework pdf.
I edited nearly every script, so I won't add this here, all commented.
I experienced some performence issues playing on the web, in the editor it was fine.
